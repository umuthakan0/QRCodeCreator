# QRCodeCreator
 
for the project to work: C:/user/your_user/your_path/this_app/QRCodes
There must be a file named because the qr codes will save the file here. If you want, you can add the path of the place to be saved by adding file dialog to the project, so there will be no need for a file called qrcodes.

I share my projects among people who want to develop like me, I hope you come to good places on the path you started.
